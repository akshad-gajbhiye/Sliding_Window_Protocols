# Sliding_Window_Protocols

rdt_Sender: It has only one state and 4 transitions to itself. We save our next packet sequence number to be sent and it is lies in the window(less than window size) then we make and send a packet and store it in an array. If it lies outside the window then we reject the packet. And whenever we receive an ACK, we change our base to ACK+1 to slide the window. If timeout occurs then it will send every packet in window again to the receiver. rdt_Receiver: It has only one state and 2 transition to itself. If the packet received is not corrupt and its sequence number also matches to the expected packet sequence number then we make an acknowledgement, send it over channel and then increase our expected packet sequence number by 1. In any other case, the receiver will send the last ACK it created.
